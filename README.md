# Infrastructure For Reproducibility

## Build a Docker image of our repository

Go to: https://mybinder.org/, then: https://github.com/meixuchen/region_satellite. Click launch. 

It will take a while to build a Docker image in your local machine the first time. Once an image has already been built, it will not be rebuilt the second time. 

Alternatively, go to: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/meixuchen/region_satellite/master to interact directly with the Binder we created and shared in the server.

## Interacting with the notebook

As the image has already been built, a JupyterHub server will host you to our repository's content. You can open the notebook and start reproducing our results. 

You are good to go to reproduce the paper!

**Note**: The image downloading section of the notebook will not work on Binder, so please skip the downloading and cropping sections and continue from the mosaicking section.
