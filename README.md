# Infrastructure for reproducibility

## Build a Docker image of our repository

Go to :https://mybinder.org/, then enter: https://github.com/meixuchen/region_satellite as Github, Click launch. 

It will take about a while to build a Docker image at the first time. If an image has already been built for the given repository, it will not be rebuilt next time. 

## Interacting with the notebooks

Since it is built, A JupyterHub server will host you to our repository's content. You can open the notebook and start reproducing the results. 

You are good to go to reproduce the paper!
